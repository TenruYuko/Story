# Story

so.. to start this off, I'll say.. with my parents permission, i was used to be raped growing up. that was "normal" to me, was my brother's friends to come over and just.. rape me. the first rough 15 times, with blood. this happened from the ages of 3ish to 9. some people used knives to convince me, some people bribed me. it was every day for those rough 6 years. avd when i hit the age of 9, i wanted to leave that filfth in my body gone. so, i started getting out of the house to avoid people. i was old enough to.. and i started learning parkour, got backflips in, got on roofs, i was amazing at it. I was *free*. but.. then i met a kid named carter on my street in the way home. he was my age or so (9), and..

carter was weird, but i tried to ignore that weird feeling i got v from him. he tried to help me fightv back against all these rapists, his parents arguing commonly.. but he tried cheering me up. his dad though, i was terrified of. he seemed just.. psychotic. 

about a year into carter avd i's friendship, his parents divorced avd carter broke. he thereafter raped me over.. avd over.. avd over. he then had the audacity to ask me if i wanted to be gay with him (bf i was trans). i didn't understand the concept of "gay" yet so i declined. he thereafter wrapped a rope around my neck until i blacked out, until i woke up with my hands tied up above my head. feet on a cold floor, bag over my head, naked. i heard carter's dad avd carter in the background, talking about recording or some shit.. i didn't know what they were talking about. 

i then felt the cold feeling of a bkade across my body. then whips. i won't get into it too much but, let's just say they left scars all over my body and genitalia. esp the latter. i was in there for about a week or two without food, very little water. Just enough to keep me alive.. and out of carter's words, he said "this is what you do when you disobey me".

i thereafter blacked out with chloroform from them...i think that's what it was, at least.. anyways. i don't remember much between then, but next "frame" i was in his house, terrified. to add, before all the torture, i had hundreds of medical tests run on me, bc things just keep not being right. I've had over a thousand blood draws just in 2003-2009 alone, some of the tests being spinal taps, PH probes, etc. it still didn't come close to the torture, but it still didn't feel good being ac test subject. 

then overall, carter just raped me every few days, while emotionally, sexually avd physically abusing me, while masquerading as my best friend. from there, i finally moved the fuck out of that town in 2013. so i endured him for 4 years. then.. the freedom i loved so dearly avd had pride in.. was crushed. i was told i had PANDAs, avd that in a year, I'd barely be able to walk, let alone run, let alone parkour.. so then i relied on 9 year old me's knowledge. i learned coding at that age, at a college level. so i started to code on roblox. j was so lonely.. so i tried making friends, but an adhd autistic squeaker on the internet isn't well treated.. so nobody really hung out with me. we weren't in a safe city, so i didn't know what was where, bc parents denied me going out mkstly while the PANDAs was in effect. so then i.. did something i regret to this day. i relied on techniques carter taught me. lies avd manipulation. so i started doing that. 

People were suddenly enamored by me. i loved it, until my empathy kicked in, i felt bad, i told them the truth... then they all left. every. single. one. that threw me into a manic attack, not feeling wanted, so i started lying and manipulating again.. yeah, you get the point. one note i didn't mention is.. i have an eidetic memory. i don't forget things. it's impossible for me to, unless my PANDAs is flaring up. 

with this cycle of lying, i lost 472 friends. i just gave up in 2016, and watched anime all day (i graduated high school at 14). so i just.. existed. i just didn't want to, almost committed suicide many times, then moved. got agoraphobic, stopped lying and manipulating, now that I'd burned every *good* bridge i had.. and then 2020 started. my whole family has the ctds, so they ended up making a protocol to shut us in and survive rather than go out and die from covid. i can't leave my house bc i likely would, I'm immunocompromised. i started to fall
 i started to get suicidal, i started to get migraines and vertigo from epileptic reasons, narcolepsy, eczema where it rips my skin just by making a fist avd it bleeds, i can't shower often bc it's outside my room, i need o2 at all times, and I'm allergic to water. so it hurts like hell, i can't breathe, and I'm panicking. every day I'm in a panic attack starting from when i wake up from nightmares to when i go to sleep. i have no "quality of life" right now, and i still live with my parents that didn't mind me being raped. I've lost 15 friends to suicide in the last 5 years, one of them faked it just to laugh at me for b being empathetic.

i don't give a fuck what my life is like. I'm going to be a beacon in this world for b people like me. a light in the darkness. i don't give a fuck what it takes, it's not like I'll ever get to b those lows again. it's not like I'll be b tortured again. so I'm going to try to be the best person i can.

that is me. i know who i am, and I've never questioned that. idgaf about trolls.. i will do what i set out to accomplish: to make the wkrldjust an inch of a better place. to push for all that i can. i don't care what it takes.
